# Secure Coding with OWASP in Angular 

This repository houses the code project for the Pluralsight course [Secure Coding with OWASP in Angular](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/angular-owasp-secure-coding).

The repository contains separate stand-alone minimal Angular projects for each module. Some projects require a corresponding server to run as well. 

## Getting going

1. Navigate into each project directory.
2. Run `npm ci` to install dependencies. You may need to do this for the Angular frontend directory and again for an Express API directory if one exists.
3. Run `npm start`. You may need to do this for the Angular directory and for an Express API directory if one exists.
